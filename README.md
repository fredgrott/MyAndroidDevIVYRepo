MyAndroidDevIVYRepo
---

Just a simple publish to local ivy repo for android app dev using gradle.
Just simple done in ant.

# Best Pratices

Same layout as the repo using maven conventions. Items not found in Maven are
store under my own namespace to avoid conflicts when they become found in maven.
